Registration & Login Form Validation
This project is all about making sure your users get the best experience when they register and log in to your site. I built a user-friendly form that validates everything from email format to password matchingâ€”because no one wants to deal with mistakes when creating an account or logging in!

Features
User Registration: Users can create an account with a username, email, and password. It checks that the email is in the correct format and that the passwords match.
Login Form: Letâ€™s users log in with their credentials. Passwords are hidden (we donâ€™t need to make things awkwardðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€).
Error Display: If somethingâ€™s wrong, the form will tell the user exactly what to fix and where. No confusion here!
"Keep Me Logged In" Option: A simple checkbox to keep users logged in for their next visit.
My Learning Journey
This project helped me practice important JavaScript skills like:

Form validation and error handling.
DOM manipulation to show error messages and provide feedback in real time.
Making sure the user experience is smooth and error-free (because who likes messing with forms?).
Iâ€™ve made sure the code is easy to follow and clean. Thereâ€™s also a spot for feedback in case things need improvementâ€”because learning is all about improvement, right? I canâ€™t wait to keep building on what Iâ€™ve learned!

How to Use-(Even though I know that you already know how to(Practicing my ReadME'sðŸ˜Ž)
Clone this repo.
Open index.html in your browser to check out the form in action.
If you're testing your form, make sure to type in the right email and matching passwords, or itâ€™ll call you out (nicely, of courseðŸ™ƒ).
